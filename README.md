### Background 
*Quantium has had a data partnership with a large supermarket brand for the last few years who provide transactional and customer data. You are an analyst within the Quantium analytics team and are responsible for delivering highly valued data analytics and insights to help the business make strategic decisions.*

*Supermarkets will regularly change their store layouts, product selections, prices and promotions. This is to satisfy their customer’s changing needs and preferences, keep up with the increasing competition in the market or to capitalise on new opportunities. The Quantium analytics team are engaged in these processes to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful.*

These tasks work through a common narrative, designed to replicate life in the Retail Analytics and Strategy team at Quantium. 

## The task
We need to analyse the data to understand current purchasing trends and behaviours. The client is particularly interested in customer segments and their chip purchasing behaviour. Consider what metrics would help describe the customers’ purchasing behaviour.  

Our insights need to have a commercial application as our end goal is to form a strategy based on the findings to provide a clear recommendation to the Category Manager.
